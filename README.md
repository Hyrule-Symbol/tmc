The Mythical Creatures
===


TODO:

- Make goblins spawned through dryad campaign to attack the dryad only
- Remove the harpy ambient threat, unless they only spawn on the mountains (maybe have them be rescuable by a quest instead)



Dryad quest ideas:

- rescue harpy from goblins
- request stone to repair golem



Golem:

- They're connected to the pillars, if the pillars are destroyed; so are the golems.
- The golems just wander around the temple, attacking anyonw who's coming too close.



Mandragora:

NOTES TAKEN FROM HYRULE:

"they're plants right?"
"They'll rarely spawn in mountains and attack if you try to kill(harvest) them"
"Potion making stuff"
"The ones i made look like stubby walking roots with eyes and a small mouth"
"they're mobs that roam around the mountains"

Their scream attack stuns the target
-add a buff that disables the target for a while
