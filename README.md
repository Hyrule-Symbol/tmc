The Mythical Creatures
===


TODO:

- Remove the harpy ambient threat, unless they only spawn on the mountains (maybe have them be rescuable by a quest instead)
- If the player harvests the ancient great tree, then the forest_myth faction becomes hostile against you
- The golems are gonna be invisible. If the pillars are destroyed then the golems become inactive, and then they will have to be rebuilt for the golems to become active again


Dryad quest ideas:

- request stone for golem



Mandragora:

NOTES TAKEN FROM HYRULE:

"they're plants right?"
"They'll rarely spawn in mountains and attack if you try to kill(harvest) them"
"Potion making stuff"
"The ones i made look like stubby walking roots with eyes and a small mouth"
"they're mobs that roam around the mountains"

Their scream attack stuns the target
-add a buff that disables the target for a while
